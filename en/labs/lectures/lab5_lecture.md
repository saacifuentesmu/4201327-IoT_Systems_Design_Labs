# Lab 5 Lecture: The Border Router — Where Four Networks Meet

**Duration**: 40 min (delivered before the hands-on lab)

**Audience**: Students about to run Lab 5 (OpenThread Border Router — host = ESP32 *or* ESP32-S3, paired with an ESP32-C6 as RCP)

**Pairs with**: [lab5.md](../lab5.md)

**Follows**: [Lab 4 Lecture](lab4_lecture.md) — students have `/env/temp` (uplink, Lab 3) and `/act/valve` (downlink, Lab 4) working on the Thread mesh, and have seen the forward hook to the four-networks redraw.

---

## Learning goals

By the end of the lecture, students should be able to:

1. Redraw the SoilSense system using the **two paired patterns from Annex A** of ISO/IEC 30141:2024 — *enterprise system pattern* (Table A.3 / Figure A.5: entities + IoT gateway) and *enterprise networking pattern* (Table A.4 / Figure A.6: proximity / access / services / user) — and locate where the OTBR sits in each.
2. Explain why the OTBR is **two physical boards** (Wi-Fi-only host + 802.15.4-only RCP) and what each one contributes.
3. Trace an IPv6 packet from a mesh node to the public internet, naming the **two address translations** that happen: SLAAC-on-the-mesh (the global-prefix advertisement) and **NAT64** (`64:ff9b::/96`).
4. Reason about the **single-OTBR failure mode** — what survives, what doesn't — and articulate the "local-first" property of the SoilSense design.
5. Switch lenses: explain why ISO/IEC 30141 has more than the six Functional domains, and why "the Border Router is RAID" is *actually wrong* per Figure A.5 (the standard places "IoT gateway" inside **SCD**, not RAID — RAID hosts access management + interchange, which lights up in Labs 6–7).

## Segment 1 — The lens just changed (0–10 min)

### Callback to last week

Lab 4 ended with Edwin's complaint solved: `/act/valve` opens reliably under loss because CON retransmits plus a sane SED poll period get the bytes there. Both contracts (`/env/temp` from Lab 3, `/act/valve` from Lab 4) are *production-grade inside the Thread mesh*.

But Daniela can't see any of it from the market. This week:

> *"My mesh is an island. How do I let the phone in?"*

Two questions to put on the board:

1. *"How many networks are between Daniela's phone and the soil sensor right now?"* — At least four, depending how you count. Thread mesh, the OTBR's Wi-Fi, the cloud provider's backbone, the carrier network. Each runs different protocols, different MTUs, different addressing.
2. *"Where do all of them meet?"* — One device. That's the lab.

### Why we stop drawing the domain ladder

Brief recap of the Lab 3 aside: ISO/IEC 30141 has **six viewpoints**, not just six domains. The six **domains** (PED / SCD / ASD / OMD / UD / RAID) are *one diagram, inside the Functional viewpoint*. Labs 1–4 climbed that ladder (PED → SCD → ASD), and the framing "Lab N is mostly domain X with a foot in domain Y" worked because every lab added one more application-stack layer to one physical device.

Today is different. Today's deliverable spans **four networks** and **multiple physical devices**, and the question "which domain is the OTBR?" has a clean answer that students often guess *wrong*. The intuitive answer — "RAID, because RAID is about reaching outside the system" — is incorrect by the standard's own Figure A.5: that figure places the **"IoT gateway" box inside SCD**, and the Table A.3 prose confirms it (*"IoT gateways are devices which connect SCD with other domains"*). RAID is a separate domain that fronts the *ASD/OMD capabilities* to outside consumers via access management + interchange — closer to a cloud-side API layer than to a Border Router. So the OTBR is an **SCD-hosted IoT gateway**. RAID stays gray on the board for one more lab.

Even with that fixed, the domain map isn't the most useful framing for the lab. Today's diagram has **four** named networks (proximity / access / services / user) connecting **six** entity domains with an IoT gateway sitting on the seam — that's a different chart from "where does the code live." The standard provides two charts designed exactly for this question, as a pair.

Put the comparison table on the board:

| Question | Useful lens | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Where do `/env/temp` and `/act/valve` live?" (Lab 3–4) | Functional viewpoint → **domain map** (Figure A.5) | One device, application stack growing upward |
| "What kind of *device* is the OTBR?" (Lab 5) | **Enterprise system pattern** (Table A.3 / Figure A.5) | The standard names "IoT gateway" with its functions |
| "How does Daniela's phone reach `/env/temp`?" (Lab 5) | **Enterprise networking pattern** (Table A.4 / Figure A.6) | Four named networks, packets crossing each in turn |
| "Is it secure end-to-end?" (Lab 6 preview) | **Trustworthiness viewpoint** | Cross-cuts every domain; not a place in the diagram |
| "Who watches the dashboard?" (Lab 7 preview) | **Usage viewpoint** + Table A.5 (usage pattern) | Roles and lifecycle, not topology |

The point: **the standard gives you several charts, and you pick the one that answers the question you're holding.** Don't tag everything as "the domain it lives in" forever — it stops being useful exactly when the question gets architectural. **A.3 and A.4 are designed together** — A.4's information row literally says *"the IoT enterprise networking pattern is using the IoT enterprise system pattern."* You cite them as a pair.

> **Drawing for the board (the new chart):** four boxes left-to-right labeled Proximity / Access / Services / User. The OTBR straddles the proximity/access boundary. Node A, Node V, and Node B are inside Proximity. Phone is inside User. Draw arrows for one full path: Node A → OTBR(prox side) → OTBR(access side) → Wi-Fi AP → cloud → carrier → Phone.

### Where Lab 5 lives in ISO/IEC 30141 — the A.3 + A.4 pair

**Step 1: read out the IoT-gateway definition from Table A.3 (the enterprise system pattern).** Project it on the board verbatim, because every line lands on the lab:

> *"IoT gateways are devices which connect SCD with other domains. IoT gateways provide functions such as protocol conversion, address mapping, data processing, information fusion, certification, and equipment management."*
> — ISO/IEC 30141:2024 §A.4, Table A.3

Walk down the six function names and tick five of them on the SoilSense OTBR:

| Function (Table A.3) | OTBR concretely does … | Where in the lab |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol conversion | NAT64 (IPv6 ↔ IPv4); none for CoAP itself (same bytes both sides) | SOP-05 §6.3 |
| Address mapping | Global-prefix SLAAC on the mesh; `64:ff9b::/96` NAT64 pool | SOP-05 §3, §6.3 |
| Data processing | *(none — the OTBR forwards, doesn't aggregate; Lab 7 problem)* | — |
| Information fusion | *(none — same reason)* | — |
| Certification | Web-UI password; Thread commissioning trust anchor | SOP-05 §3 step 1 |
| Equipment management | Web UI topology view, dataset, prefix configuration | SOP-05 §3 |

Five of six. That's the point — **the standard already wrote down what this device does**; the lab is one concrete implementation. Cite this exact mapping in the DDR.

**Step 2: redraw the SoilSense system using Table A.4 / Figure A.6 (the networking pattern).** Four networks, four boxes, OTBR straddling the proximity/access boundary:

```
Enterprise networking pattern (Table A.4 / Figure A.6):
    [Proximity]     [Access]       [Services]      [User]
       │              │               │              │
   Thread mesh    Wi-Fi/Ethernet   Cloud APIs   Phone/Browser
       │              │               │              │
       └──────┬───────┘               │              │
              │                       │              │
            OTBR  ────────────────────┴──────────────┘
        (the "IoT gateway" of Table A.3, sitting on a network boundary)
```

The OTBR isn't *in* a single network — it's **on the boundary between two of them** (proximity and access) and the rest of the chain follows. The standard pre-anticipated exactly this: A.4 (networking) is defined as *using* A.3 (system).

If you place this in the **Functional viewpoint's six-domain map** (Figure A.5): the OTBR is an **SCD-hosted IoT gateway**, *not* a RAID device. Figure A.5 draws the "IoT gateway" box inside the SCD; the Table A.3 prose says IoT gateways *"connect SCD with other domains."* This is the standard's stated home for it. **RAID** (access management component + interchange subsystem) is where authentication and capability-exposure-to-outside-consumers lives — that's a Lab 6 (DTLS as access management) and Lab 7 (dashboard's exposed APIs as interchange) story. The OTBR *extends* SCD outward toward those other domains; it doesn't *become* them. Cite Figure A.5 explicitly in the DDR so this stays straight.

Use the A.3 + A.4 pair as the lab's primary deliverable; the domain-map answer is "SCD, by the standard's own diagram."

> **Two-minute caution about the aside in the Lab 3 lecture:** the aside promised the dominant lens would shift around Lab 5. This is the shift. Don't let students conclude "domains were wrong" — domains were the right lens for Labs 1–4 because the question those labs were holding was "where in the application stack are we adding code?" The question today is "across how many networks does a packet travel, and what crosses each boundary?" — and that question has its own chart. **Same standard, different chart.**

---

## Segment 2 — The OTBR up close (10–22 min)

### Part A: Why the Border Router is two boards

The naive expectation: "buy a board with Wi-Fi *and* Thread, run OTBR on it." That board exists (Nordic nRF7002 + nRF52840 module, some Silicon Labs combos), but the *software architecture* of OTBR is built around the **NCP/RCP model**, not a single-chip stack. Worth a board sketch:

```
   ┌──────────────────────────────┐        ┌────────────────────┐
   │  Host (ESP32 / ESP32-S3)     │        │  RCP (ESP32-C6)    │
   │                              │ UART   │                    │
   │  - OpenThread Border Router  │ Spinel │  - 802.15.4 PHY    │
   │  - NAT64 (software)          │ <───>  │  - 802.15.4 MAC    │
   │  - `ot` CLI (mgmt surface)   │ 460800 │  - Just a "modem"  │
   │  - Wi-Fi / Ethernet driver   │        │  - No CoAP, no app │
   │                              │        │                    │
   │  Wi-Fi  <──>  AP             │        │  Radio  <──>  Mesh │
   └──────────────────────────────┘        └────────────────────┘
        ^                                       ^
        │                                       │
        IPv6 + NAT64 + RA                       IEEE 802.15.4 frames
```

Three things students should leave with:

1. **The RCP is dumb on purpose.** It has no CoAP stack, no IP stack, no application logic. It hands raw 802.15.4 frames up over Spinel/UART and the host does everything else. This means upgrading the host's OTBR is easy (it's the host's firmware); the RCP almost never changes.
2. **The host's CPU does the IPv6 work.** 6LoWPAN decompression, mesh route lookup, NAT64 translation, Router Advertisement on the Wi-Fi side — all on the host. The RCP-C6 just transmits/receives bytes.
3. **One device, from the network's point of view.** The mesh sees one Thread node (the OTBR); the Wi-Fi AP sees one Wi-Fi client (the OTBR). The fact that there are two MCUs inside is an *implementation detail* of how Espressif builds the OTBR appliance. A Raspberry Pi 4 + USB-attached `ot_rcp` is the same architecture, different host. So is the official `openthread/otbr-sel-ci` Docker image.

> **First-principles question to drop:** *"Why doesn't the RCP just run an IP stack itself and forward via TCP/UDP to the host?"* Expected: latency through the link (Spinel/UART is microseconds; TCP framing would add milliseconds and dropped-packet recovery), and the upgrade story (NCP-mode RCPs *do* run an IP stack; they're harder to update because the host can't see what's wrong). RCP mode is the architecturally cleanest split and what Thread Group standardized on.

### Part B: The two address translations

This is the technical heart of the lecture. Two questions, two answers.

#### B.1 — How does the mesh get a global address at all?

Before the OTBR, every node had only mesh-local addresses (`fd<random>::N`, valid only inside the mesh). After the OTBR forms, **two things happen at the same time**:

```
1. OTBR advertises a global IPv6 prefix on the mesh side:
       fd<otbr-prefix>::/64    paros flags (preferred, advertised, on-mesh,
                                              default-route, stable)

2. Every node hears the advertisement, picks an IID, and assigns itself
   a new IPv6 address with that prefix.  This is SLAAC — RFC 4862 —
   the same stateless autoconfig your laptop does on home Wi-Fi.

   Node A's IID is normally derived from its 802.15.4 EUI-64
   (e.g. ::ff:fe00:0001).  Result on Node A's `ipaddr`:

       fe80::1234:...          link-local
       fd<orig-mesh-local>::1  mesh-local EID (unchanged)
       fd<otbr-prefix>::ff:fe00:0001    ← the new global address
```

**Two important consequences:**

- **No new resource needed at the OTBR.** The OTBR doesn't proxy `/env/temp` — it advertises the prefix and routes the packets. Same bytes, new path. The mesh-local `/env/temp` server now has a global address by virtue of the SLAAC, and an external client just hits that address directly.
- **The OTBR is a router, not a proxy.** This is the same distinction as a home Wi-Fi router vs. a cloud API gateway. The OTBR forwards IPv6 datagrams; it doesn't terminate connections, doesn't parse CoAP, doesn't translate JSON↔CBOR. (You *can* add a CoAP↔HTTP proxy on top — Lab 7 — but it's separate from being an OTBR.)

> **Teaching hook:** "If you've ever set up an OpenWrt router on a home network and watched it `radvd` an IPv6 prefix to your laptop, this is exactly the same thing — just on the 802.15.4 side instead of Ethernet. The OTBR is not magic; it's an IPv6 router that happens to have a 802.15.4 radio."

#### B.2 — How does an IPv6-only mesh reach the IPv4 internet?

Most of the public internet is still IPv4-only. Thread nodes are IPv6-only. Bridge: **NAT64** — RFC 6146 — combined with a well-known prefix the IETF reserves for this exact purpose: **`64:ff9b::/96`** (RFC 6052).

Walk through it byte by byte on the board:

```
Node A wants to reach 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS, IPv4).

1. Node A sends an IPv6 packet to:    64:ff9b:0:0:0:0:0808:0808
                                                    └──┬──┘
                                                       │
                                       last 32 bits = 8.8.8.8 in hex
                                       (0x08 0x08 0x08 0x08)

2. Packet routes (via the global prefix advertisement) to the OTBR.

3. OTBR sees `64:ff9b::/96` and runs NAT64:
       - rewrites src: IPv6 → IPv4 (from a NAT pool on the OTBR's Wi-Fi side)
       - rewrites dst: extract last 32 bits → 8.8.8.8
       - forwards as an IPv4 packet out the Wi-Fi interface.

4. Google replies to OTBR's Wi-Fi IPv4.
5. OTBR reverses the translation, sends IPv6 back to Node A.
```

The NAT table maps `(IPv6 src, port) ↔ (IPv4 src, port)` — same idea as a home router's NAT44, just with an extra protocol-conversion step.

**Latency cost of NAT64:** ~5–20 ms on a Raspberry Pi-class OTBR; usually invisible on an ESP32-class host too. The dominant cost is the **Wi-Fi RTT to the upstream and the 802.15.4 latency to the node**, not the translation itself.

> **First-principles question to drop:** *"NAT64 lets IPv6 reach IPv4. What about the reverse — could an IPv4-only phone reach our IPv6-only sensor?"* Expected: not directly. You'd need **464XLAT** (CLAT on the phone side) or a CoAP↔HTTP proxy that terminates IPv6 on one side and IPv4 on the other. This is exactly why most "IoT cloud" architectures put a real HTTP/MQTT broker on the access side instead of trying to make end-to-end IPv6 work — a topic we'll come back to in Lab 7.

### Part C: What the bytes look like crossing the boundary

The crucial property: **the CoAP/CBOR payload doesn't change.** Six bytes for `/env/temp`, four bytes for `/act/valve`, identical on both sides of the OTBR. Draw this:

```
Inside mesh:   [802.15.4 hdr][6LoWPAN/IPHC][UDP][CoAP][CBOR a16174f9...]
                ~10–15 B       ~5 B           8 B   ~12 B   6 B

OTBR Wi-Fi side: [Eth/802.11 hdr][full IPv6][UDP][CoAP][CBOR a16174f9...]
                  ~30 B            40 B       8 B   ~12 B   6 B

                                              └────────┬────────┘
                                              identical bytes, identical app
```

What grew: the **link-layer + IPv6 headers** expanded because Wi-Fi doesn't have 6LoWPAN's IPHC compression. The application payload is byte-identical. This is *why* CoAP is a useful choice for IoT — it doesn't break when it leaves the constrained network. (Contrast: a custom 4-byte binary protocol would need a translator at the boundary. CoAP just routes.)

---

## Segment 3 — Single-OTBR failure mode + alternative architectures (22–32 min)

### Part A: What happens when the OTBR dies

Kill the OTBR (pull power on the host, or `ot thread stop`) and ask what survives:

| What still works | Why |
|---|---|
| Node B (in-mesh) → Node A `coap get /env/temp` | All inside Proximity; OTBR was never on the path. |
| Node B → Node V `coap put /act/valve` | Same. Edwin in the field has a laptop, things still work. |
| Mesh self-healing if a Router dies | Lab 2 property; OTBR isn't a Router for that purpose. |

| What stops working | Why |
|---|---|
| Daniela's phone reaching `/env/temp` | The Proximity↔Access boundary is gone. |
| Node A → `ping 64:ff9b::8.8.8.8` | NAT64 lived on the OTBR. |
| The BR's `ot` CLI / `ot child table` view | Obviously — the host is off. |
| New nodes joining via OTBR-side commissioning | But existing dataset works; you can re-commission from an in-mesh Joiner. |

This is the **local-first property** of SoilSense: **the system degrades gracefully** when the off-mesh path disappears. That's not an accident; it's a consequence of choosing Thread + CoAP. The valve isn't waiting for the cloud to tell it to open — the cloud is just a viewer.

> **Compare to a hypothetical Wi-Fi-only SoilSense** where every sensor connects to AWS IoT directly: if the Wi-Fi router dies, *every sensor* is offline, even Node B sitting next to Node A. The mesh + OTBR architecture isolates field failures from cloud failures. This is the single best argument for Thread in this lab and worth driving home.

**Production answer:** **two OTBRs**, Thread 1.2's **Multi-BR feature** picks one as primary, fails over to the secondary if the primary stops advertising. We don't deploy two for this lab — the pilot fleet has one — but the production ADR-005 entry should explicitly call out single-OTBR as a *pilot* compromise.

### Part B: Other gateways — same role, different protocols

The OTBR is one instance of the **gateway pattern**. Other constrained-network stacks solve the same problem differently:

| Stack | The "OTBR equivalent" | Where it sits |
|---|---|---|
| **Thread / 6LoWPAN** (this lab) | OpenThread Border Router | Mesh ↔ IP (transparent, IPv6 native) |
| **LoRaWAN** | LoRaWAN Gateway + Network Server (TTN, ChirpStack) | Mesh-less star ↔ MQTT/HTTP (translates at app layer) |
| **BLE Mesh** | A phone or hub running a "provisioner" + cloud bridge | Mesh ↔ BLE GATT proxy ↔ phone/cloud |
| **Zigbee** | Zigbee Coordinator + bridge (Hue Bridge, SmartThings Hub) | Mesh ↔ HTTP/MQTT (translates at app layer) |
| **Matter (smart-home superset)** | A "Border Router" *that's literally a Thread BR* for the Thread fabric, plus mDNS/IPv6 for the Wi-Fi fabric | Same as Thread, plus discovery |

Two observations students should leave with:

1. **The Thread choice gives you IPv6 end-to-end.** The OTBR is a *network-layer* bridge — no application-layer translation. LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and most non-IP IoT stacks make you translate at the application layer (a LoRa packet has nothing to do with a CoAP request; the gateway's job is to *interpret*, not just *forward*). The Matter story is "IPv6 everywhere," for exactly this reason.
2. **The choice cascades.** Pick LoRaWAN, and your "OTBR" is a Linux box running a network server, and your "API" is whatever HTTP/MQTT contract that network server exposes — *not* CoAP. Pick BLE-via-phone, and your gateway is the user's phone, and the system stops working when the phone is in airplane mode. Pick Thread + OTBR (you did), and your CoAP contract from Labs 3–4 keeps working unchanged on the cloud side.

> **Teaching hook:** "You picked Thread in Lab 1, before you knew what an OTBR was. Today is the day you find out *what you bought*: end-to-end IPv6 with no application-layer translator. That's the difference between SoilSense and a LoRaWAN equivalent. It's not better in every dimension — LoRaWAN reaches 10 km on a battery — but it's structurally different in one important way: the bytes don't change at the boundary."

---

## Segment 4 — Lab bridge (32–40 min)

### What they are about to do

Walk through [lab5.md](../lab5.md) at high speed:

1. **Task A — OTBR bring-up.** RCP flash, ot_br host flash, then from the host's `ot` CLI: `ot wifi connect` → `ot dataset init new` → `ot ifconfig up` → `ot thread start` → `ot br init 1 1`. Then re-commission Lab 3 / Lab 4 nodes with `dataset clear; dataset set active <hex>`. [SOP-05 §1–§4](../sops/sop05_border_router.md#1-flash-the-radio-co-processor-rcp).
2. **Task B — Global prefix verification.** Run `ipaddr` on Node A and Node V; confirm two non-link-local addresses. The new one with the OTBR's prefix is what makes the mesh reachable.
3. **Task C — Three latency numbers.** Reproduce the Lab 3 in-mesh baseline, hit the same `/env/temp` from your laptop via the global address, and ping `64:ff9b::8.8.8.8` from Node A. Fill the three-row table. The delta is the headline.

### Practical reminders

- **Web UI password first.** The OTBR is now on your Wi-Fi. Default credentials = anyone on the AP can reform your network.
- **The "third C6" is a separate board** — you can't repurpose Node A, B, or V into an RCP without losing their CoAP servers. Budget for the fifth board in advance.
- **Wi-Fi at 5 GHz only will not work.** ESP32, S3, and C6 are all 2.4 GHz. If your AP is dual-band, force the host onto the 2.4 GHz SSID — or run a phone hotspot at 2.4 GHz.
- **`dataset clear` before `dataset set active`** when moving nodes from the Lab 2/3 mesh to the OTBR-formed mesh. Otherwise the old PANID conflicts.
- **The IDF `ot_br` example has no web UI.** Management is the `ot` CLI on the host's serial console — same paradigm as Labs 2–4. (Distributions that *do* ship a web UI — Raspberry Pi `otbr-web`, the separate `esp-thread-br` SDK — exist, and we mention them once for context. They are not used in this lab.) Lab 6 adds DTLS on the CoAP side; the management surface here remains "whoever holds the USB cable" — fine for the lab, a production gap to flag in the DDR.

### The puzzles to seed

Two this week. Don't answer either.

> *"You verified `ping 64:ff9b::8.8.8.8` works from Node A. You then disconnect the OTBR from Wi-Fi (leave it powered, kill the Wi-Fi credentials). What is the *first* address the ping fails to reach, and why is it not the failure mode you'd expect from reading the diagram?"*

> *"Daniela wants the dashboard to show data from 200 sensors deployed across three fields. Each field has one OTBR. The dashboard is a phone app, hitting `coap://[<prefix>:ff:fe00:N]/env/temp` for each sensor. What's the first thing that breaks at this fleet size, and why is it a property of the gateway pattern, not of the cloud?"*

The first puzzle is the **NAT64 vs prefix-advertisement** distinction: the ping fails *immediately* because NAT64 lives on the OTBR, but `coap get` to *another in-mesh node* via the global prefix also fails, because the route advertisement (RA) traveled over Wi-Fi too — without the OTBR's Wi-Fi side, no laptop knows the prefix is routable. (The mesh-local addresses still work from inside the mesh.)

The second puzzle previews **fleet-scale gateway problems**: a phone hitting 200 distinct IPv6 addresses opens 200 sockets, holds 200 CoAP exchange states, and triggers 200 separate Observe registrations. The gateway pattern doesn't scale to fleets — *that* is what you need a cloud broker / aggregator for, which is exactly Lab 7's territory.

### What Lab 6 will answer

> *"Our `/env/temp` and `/act/valve` are now reachable from the public internet through the OTBR. Anyone who knows the global address can read sensor data and command the valve. How do we put a lock on the door without killing battery life?"*

Preview: the lens shifts *again* — from networking pattern to the **Trustworthiness viewpoint** (cross-cutting, not a domain). DTLS over CoAP, pre-shared keys vs certificates, the energy cost of the handshake, the §9 trustworthiness audit in the DDR. The Border Router stays where it is; we're adding a lock to the bytes, not changing the path.

## Instructor checklist

- [ ] Domain ladder → A.3 + A.4 pattern pair transition explained explicitly (segment 1). Don't let students think Labs 1–4 were "wrong."
- [ ] Table A.3 "IoT gateway" quote on the board verbatim; the five-of-six function mapping table walked through.
- [ ] Four-network chart (Proximity / Access / Services / User) drawn on the board with the OTBR straddling Proximity/Access.
- [ ] Two-board OTBR architecture sketch (Wi-Fi-only host + C6 RCP + Spinel/UART) drawn out.
- [ ] SLAAC walk: prefix advertisement → node gets second IPv6 → `ipaddr` shows both.
- [ ] NAT64 worked example: `64:ff9b::0808:0808` ↔ `8.8.8.8`.
- [ ] Byte diagram showing identical CBOR payload on both sides of the OTBR.
- [ ] Single-OTBR failure-mode table (what survives, what doesn't) on the board.
- [ ] Comparison row: Thread/OTBR vs LoRaWAN/gateway vs BLE-via-phone vs Zigbee/coordinator.
- [ ] Both puzzles posed and left unanswered.
- [ ] One live demo: `coap get` from the laptop hitting Node A's *global* address, showing the same `a16174f9...` bytes that Node B sees in-mesh. This is the moment the lab clicks.
