## Lab 1: IEEE 802.15.4 Physical Layer

### 1.1 Why O-QPSK Modulation?

**The Problem**: IoT devices need long battery life, which requires efficient power amplifiers (PAs).

**Modulation Comparison**:

| Modulation | Envelope | PA Efficiency | Complexity | Data Rate |
|------------|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| ASK | Varying | Low (20-30%) | Simple | Low |
| FSK | Constant | Medium (40-50%) | Medium | Medium |
| QPSK | Varying | Low (20-30%) | Medium | High |
| **O-QPSK** | **Constant** | **High (60-70%)** | Medium | High |

**Key Insight**: **Constant envelope modulation** allows use of non-linear (Class C/E) power amplifiers.

**Why O-QPSK?**
- **Offset QPSK** staggers I and Q transitions by half a symbol period
- Eliminates 180° phase transitions (which cause amplitude peaks in QPSK)
- Result: **Constant envelope** = efficient PA = longer battery life

**The Math**:
```
O-QPSK: I(t) delayed by Ts/2 relative to Q(t)
Phase transitions: Only 0°, ±90° (never 180°)
Amplitude variation: <3 dB (vs QPSK's >10 dB)
PA efficiency gain: 60-70% vs 20-30% = 3× improvement
```

**Energy Impact**:
```
Linear PA @ 20% efficiency:   100 mW TX power requires 500 mW input
Non-linear PA @ 60% efficiency: 100 mW TX power requires 167 mW input

Battery life improvement: 3× for the same TX power
```

### 1.2 Link Budget Fundamentals

**Goal**: Determine maximum communication range given TX power and receiver sensitivity.

**Friis Transmission Equation**:
```
Received Power (dBm) = TX Power (dBm) - Path Loss (dB) + Antenna Gain (dBi)
```

**Free-Space Path Loss** (FSPL):
```
FSPL (dB) = 20 log₁₀(d) + 20 log₁₀(f) - 27.55

Where:
- d = distance in meters
- f = frequency in MHz
- 27.55 is a constant for metric units
```

**Example Calculation** (IEEE 802.15.4 @ 2.4 GHz, 10 meters):
```
TX Power:     +5 dBm (ESP32-C6)
Frequency:    2400 MHz
Distance:     10 meters
Antenna Gain: 0 dBi (omnidirectional)

Path Loss = 20 log₁₀(10) + 20 log₁₀(2400) - 27.55
          = 20 + 67.6 - 27.55
          = 60.05 dB

Received Power = +5 dBm - 60.05 dB + 0 dBi = -55.05 dBm

Receiver Sensitivity: -100 dBm (ESP32-C6)

Link Margin = Received Power - Sensitivity
            = -55.05 - (-100)
            = 44.95 dB ✓
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Positive margin**: Link closes (communication possible)
- **44.95 dB margin**: Sufficient for obstacles, fading, interference

**Factors Reducing Margin**:
| Factor | Loss | Result at 10m |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Drywall (1) | -5 to -10 dB | -60 to -65 dBm |
| Concrete wall | -10 to -20 dB | -65 to -75 dBm |
| Metal barrier | -20 to -40 dB | -75 to -95 dBm |
| Human body | -3 to -5 dB | -58 to -60 dBm |
| Vegetation | -10 to -30 dB | -65 to -85 dBm |

**Practical Range**:
```
Indoor (residential):     30-50 meters
Outdoor (line-of-sight):  100-200 meters
Through 2-3 walls:        10-20 meters
```

### 1.3 CSMA/CA Collision Avoidance

**The Problem**: Multiple devices sharing the same channel can collide.

**Why Not CSMA/CD** (Ethernet's approach)?
- CSMA/CD listens while transmitting, detects collision by voltage spike
- **RF limitation**: Cannot listen while transmitting (half-duplex radio)
- **Solution**: CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance) - prevent collisions before they happen

**CSMA/CA Algorithm** (IEEE 802.15.4):
```
1. Listen (CCA - Clear Channel Assessment)
   - Measure RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)
   - If RSSI < threshold (e.g., -75 dBm): channel is clear
   - If RSSI ≥ threshold: channel is busy

2. If busy:
   - Wait for random backoff period (0 to 2^BE - 1 slots)
   - BE (Backoff Exponent) starts at 3, max 5
   - Each slot = 320 µs

3. If clear:
   - Transmit frame
   - Wait for ACK
   - If ACK received: success
   - If no ACK: collision likely, retry (up to 3 retries)
```

**Binary Exponential Backoff**:
```
Attempt 1: Random(0, 2³-1) = 0-7 slots   → 0-2.24 ms
Attempt 2: Random(0, 2⁴-1) = 0-15 slots  → 0-4.8 ms
Attempt 3: Random(0, 2⁵-1) = 0-31 slots  → 0-9.92 ms
```

**Why Exponential?**
- Light load: Low backoff, minimal delay
- Heavy load: Higher backoff, reduces collision probability
- **Trade-off**: Latency vs throughput

---

### 1.4 Energy per Bit

**TX Energy Calculation**:
```
Energy (Joules) = Power (Watts) × Time (seconds)

For ESP32-C6:
TX Power: 100 mW (20 dBm)
TX Time:  32 bytes @ 250 kbps = (32 × 8) / 250,000 = 1.024 ms
Energy =  0.1 W × 0.001024 s = 102.4 µJ

Energy per bit = 102.4 µJ / 256 bits = 0.4 µJ/bit
```

**Battery Impact**:
```
Battery: 2× AA = 2500 mAh @ 3V = 9000 mWh = 32,400 J

Number of TX frames = 32,400 J / 0.0001024 J = 316 million frames

If transmitting once per second:
Lifetime = 316M seconds ÷ (60 × 60 × 24) = 3,657 days ≈ 10 years
```

**Reality Check**: Why don't batteries last 10 years?
- RX consumes power (listening for ACKs, mesh routing)
- CPU active time (processing, crypto)
- Sleep mode isn't zero power (leakage current)
- Self-discharge of battery (~5% per year)

**Practical lifetime with duty cycling**: 6-12 months

---

### Lab 1 Discussion Questions

1. **Why does increasing TX power not linearly increase range?**
   - Hint: Path loss scales logarithmically with distance

2. **What happens if two devices start transmission at exactly the same time?**
   - Collision → no ACK → backoff and retry
   - Why is this rare? Backoff randomization

3. **Why does IEEE 802.15.4 use 250 kbps instead of higher data rates?**
   - Higher rate = less time per bit = less energy per bit (good)
   - But: Higher rate = less processing gain, worse sensitivity (bad)
   - 250 kbps balances energy efficiency and range

---

## Lab 2: 6LoWPAN and IPv6

### 2.1 The MTU Problem

**MTU** (Maximum Transmission Unit): Largest packet sent in one frame.

| Protocol | MTU |
|----------|-----|
| Ethernet | 1500 bytes |
| IEEE 802.15.4 | **127 bytes** |

**IPv6 Header** (uncompressed): **40 bytes**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Version (4) | Traffic Class (8) | Flow (20)│  4 bytes
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Payload Length (16) | Next Header (8) |    │  4 bytes
│ Hop Limit (8)                              │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Source Address (128 bits)                  │ 16 bytes
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Destination Address (128 bits)             │ 16 bytes
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Total: 40 bytes
```

**Problem**: 40-byte IPv6 header + 17-byte 802.15.4 overhead = **57 bytes** before any payload!
- Leaves only 127 - 57 = **70 bytes** for application data
- Add UDP (8 bytes) → Only **62 bytes** for payload
- Efficiency: 62 / 127 = **49%**

---

### 2.2 6LoWPAN Header Compression (IPHC)

**Key Observations**:
1. Most IPv6 fields are predictable in a local network
2. Addresses can be derived from 802.15.4 addresses
3. Many fields have common values (e.g., Hop Limit = 64)

**Compression Results**:
```
Uncompressed IPv6: 40 bytes
Compressed (IPHC):  2-3 bytes

Savings: 37-38 bytes!
```

**Address Compression Example**:
```
Uncompressed:
Source: fe80::0200:5eef:1234:5678 (16 bytes)
Dest:   fe80::0200:5eef:abcd:ef01 (16 bytes)
Total: 32 bytes

Compressed (using 802.15.4 addresses):
Source: Derived from MAC layer (0 bytes in IPv6 header)
Dest:   Derived from MAC layer (0 bytes in IPv6 header)
Total: 0 bytes in IPv6 header!
```

**Efficiency Comparison**:

| Protocol Stack | Header Overhead | 50-byte Payload | Efficiency |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Uncompressed** | 65 bytes | 115 bytes | 43% |
| **6LoWPAN** | 24 bytes | 74 bytes | **68%** |
| **Savings** | 41 bytes | 41 bytes | +25 pp |

**Energy Impact**:
```
Uncompressed: 115 bytes @ 250 kbps = 3.68 ms TX time
Compressed:    74 bytes @ 250 kbps = 2.37 ms TX time

TX energy savings: 35% per packet
```

---

### 2.3 Fragmentation

**Problem**: Even with compression, packets can exceed 127 bytes.

**6LoWPAN Fragmentation**:
```
200-byte payload → 2 fragments:

Fragment 1:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ Fragmentation Header (4 bytes) │
│ IPv6 + UDP headers (7 bytes)   │
│ Payload chunk 1 (110 bytes)    │
└────────────────────────────────┘
Total: 121 bytes

Fragment 2:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ Fragmentation Header (5 bytes) │
│ Payload chunk 2 (90 bytes)     │
└────────────────────────────────┘
Total: 95 bytes
```

**Challenges**:
- **Packet loss**: If any fragment lost, entire datagram retransmitted
- **Buffering**: Receiver must buffer fragments
- **Timeout**: Incomplete datagrams discarded after 60 seconds

**Recommendation**: Keep payloads small to avoid fragmentation.

---

### Lab 2 Discussion Questions

1. **Why does 6LoWPAN compress headers but not payload data?**
   - Headers are predictable (known structure), payload is arbitrary
   - Application-layer compression (CBOR) handles payload

2. **What happens if the Border Router doesn't support compression?**
   - It must! Border Router decompresses before forwarding to IP network

3. **Why not use bigger frames (increase MTU)?**
   - Larger frames = longer TX time = higher collision probability
   - 127 bytes @ 250 kbps = 4 ms (acceptable)
   - 1500 bytes @ 250 kbps = 48 ms (too long)

---

## Lab 3: Thread Mesh Networking

### 3.1 Why Mesh Topology?

**Star Topology** (classic WiFi):
```
Device A    Device B    Device C
     ↘         ↓         ↙
         Access Point
```
- **Pros**: Simple, centralized control
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, limited range (max 1 hop)

**Mesh Topology** (Thread):
```
[Router A] ←→ [Router B] ←→ [Router C]
     ↕            ↕            ↕
[End Dev 1]  [End Dev 2]  [End Dev 3]
```
- **Pros**: Self-healing, extended range (multi-hop)
- **Cons**: Complex routing, leader election overhead

**Range Extension**:
```
Star:           Max range = 1 × radio range (50m)
Mesh (3 hops):  Max range = 3 × radio range (150m)
```

---

### 3.2 Routing Algorithms

**Distance Vector Routing** (Thread uses a variant):

Each router maintains a routing table:
```
┌─────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ Destination │ Next Hop │   Cost   │
├─────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ Router A    │ Direct   │    1     │
│ Router B    │ Router A │    2     │
│ Router C    │ Router B │    3     │
└─────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

**Route Cost Calculation**:
```
Cost = Base Cost + Link Quality + Hop Count

Example:
Router A → Router B: LQI = 200 (good) → Cost = 1
Router A → Router C (via B): LQI = 150 → Cost = 2
Router A → Router C (direct): LQI = 50 (poor) → Cost = 5

Best route: A → B → C (cost 2) vs A → C (cost 5)
```

**Link Quality Indicator** (LQI):
- 0-255 scale from IEEE 802.15.4
- **LQI > 200**: Excellent (PER < 1%)
- **LQI 100-200**: Good (PER 1-10%)
- **LQI < 100**: Poor (PER > 10%)

**Convergence Time**:
- Small network (< 10 routers): 30-60 seconds
- Large network (32 routers): 90-120 seconds

---

### 3.3 Leader Election

**Why a Leader?**
- Centralized network parameters (PAN ID, channel, keys)
- Assign Router IDs (unique 1-byte IDs)
- Handle network-wide decisions

**Election Algorithm** (simplified):
```
1. Each device has a "weight":
   Weight = (# neighbors) × 100 + (uptime minutes) + random(0-99)

2. Broadcast "I am leader with weight W"

3. If receive higher weight:
   - Demote self to router
   - Accept new leader

4. If leader not heard for 60 seconds:
   - Assume leader failed
   - Restart election
```

**Example**:
```
Router A: 5 neighbors, uptime 10 min → Weight = 552
Router B: 3 neighbors, uptime 20 min → Weight = 393
Router C: 4 neighbors, uptime 15 min → Weight = 433

Router A wins (highest weight) → Becomes Leader
```

---

### 3.4 Network Partitions

**Scenario**: Network splits due to interference or node failure.

```
Before:
[Leader A] ←→ [Router B] ←→ [Router C] ←→ [Router D]

After (link B-C fails):
Partition 1: [Leader A] ←→ [Router B]
Partition 2: [Router C] ←→ [Router D]
```

**What Happens**:
1. Partition 1: Leader A still in charge
2. Partition 2: Election triggered → Router C or D becomes new leader
3. Two independent networks form
4. When link restored: Leaders compared, lower-weight demotes → merge

**Partition Detection Time**: ~100-130 seconds

---

### 3.5 Latency Analysis

**Single-Hop Latency**:
```
Components:
1. Queue delay:       1-10 ms
2. CSMA/CA backoff:   1-5 ms
3. TX time:           1.6 ms (50 bytes)
4. RX processing:     1 ms
5. ACK delay:         0.5 ms

Total: ~5-20 ms per hop
```

**Multi-Hop Latency**:
| Hops | Typical Latency |
|------|-----------------|
| 1 | 10-30 ms |
| 3 | 30-100 ms |
| 5 | 50-200 ms |

**Implication**: Thread suitable for monitoring (100-1000 ms), not real-time control (< 10 ms).

---

### Lab 3 Discussion Questions

1. **Why does Thread limit routers to 32?**
   - Routing table size: 32 entries = manageable memory
   - Convergence time: More routers = longer convergence

2. **What happens if two leaders have the same weight?**
   - Tie-breaker: Compare Router ID (deterministic)

3. **Can mesh have zero latency increase per hop?**
   - No: Each hop adds queuing + TX time (fundamental limit)

---

## Lab 4: CoAP Application Protocol

### 4.1 Why REST for IoT?

**REST Constraints**:
1. **Client-Server**: Separation of concerns
2. **Stateless**: Each request contains all information
3. **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached
4. **Uniform Interface**: Standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

**HTTP vs CoAP**:

| Feature | HTTP | CoAP |
|---------|------|------|
| Transport | TCP | UDP |
| Header size | 200-500 bytes | **4-10 bytes** |
| Methods | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| Reliability | TCP guarantees | Optional CON messages |
| Observe | Server-Sent Events | Native (RFC 7641) |

---

### 4.2 CoAP Message Format

**Header** (4 bytes minimum):
```
┌───┬───┬─────┬──────────┬────────────────┐
│Ver│ T │ TKL │   Code   │   Message ID   │
│2b │2b │ 4b  │   8b     │      16b       │
└───┴───┴─────┴──────────┴────────────────┘
```

**Fields**:
- **Ver**: Version (always 1)
- **T**: Type (CON, NON, ACK, RST)
- **TKL**: Token Length (0-8 bytes)
- **Code**: Method (GET=0.01) or Status (2.05=Content)
- **Message ID**: For duplicate detection

**Example GET**:
```
CoAP: 18 bytes
HTTP: 100-150 bytes

Savings: 5-8× smaller
```

---

### 4.3 Reliability Without TCP

**CON (Confirmable) Messages**:
```
Client                          Server
   | CON [MsgID=0x1234]            |
   | GET /sensors/temp             |
   |------------------------------>|
   |       ACK [MsgID=0x1234]      |
   |       2.05 Content "23.5°C"   |
   |<------------------------------|
```

**If ACK not received** (exponential backoff):
```
Attempt 1: Wait random(2-3 seconds)
Attempt 2: Wait random(4-6 seconds)
Attempt 3: Wait random(8-12 seconds)
Attempt 4: Wait random(16-24 seconds)
Max wait: ~45 seconds
```

**When to use CON vs NON**:

| Use Case | Type | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Critical sensor reading | CON | Must ensure delivery |
| Periodic telemetry | NON | Occasional loss OK |
| Actuator command | CON | Must confirm execution |
| Heartbeat | NON | Next one arrives soon |

---

### 4.4 Idempotency in Lossy Networks

**Idempotent**: Can apply multiple times, same result.

```
Idempotent:
- GET /sensors/temp     → Same result always
- PUT /led {"on":true}  → LED is on, repeated = still on

Non-Idempotent:
- POST /counter/inc     → Different result each time
```

**Why It Matters** (ACK lost scenario):
```
Client sends PUT → Server executes → ACK lost → Client retransmits

Idempotent (PUT): LED still "on" ✓
Non-Idempotent (POST counter++): Counter incremented twice ✗
```

**Solution**: Use idempotent operations or duplicate detection.

---

### 4.5 CoAP Observe (Pub/Sub)

**Polling** (inefficient):
```
Client sends GET every second
Server responds every second
Even when data hasn't changed → wasted bandwidth
```

**Observe** (RFC 7641):
```
Client                          Server
   | GET /sensors/temp             |
   | Observe: 0 (register)         |
   |------------------------------>|
   |       2.05 "23.5°C"           |
   |       Observe: 1              |
   |<------------------------------|
   |                               | (data changes)
   |       2.05 "24.0°C"           |
   |       Observe: 2              |
   |<------------------------------|
```

**Energy savings**: 10-100× reduction in traffic.

---

### Lab 4 Discussion Questions

1. **Why does CoAP use UDP instead of TCP?**
   - TCP overhead: 3-way handshake, state maintenance
   - CoAP adds reliability only when needed

2. **What if server restarts and loses Observe registrations?**
   - Client detects timeout, re-registers

3. **Is CoAP suitable for real-time control?**
   - Typical latency: 60-250 ms (Thread + CoAP)
   - OK for HVAC, lighting; not for motor control

---

## Lab 5: Border Router

### 5.1 The Gateway Function

**Problem**: Thread network (IPv6, 802.15.4) must communicate with external networks (IPv4/IPv6, Ethernet/WiFi).

**Border Router Responsibilities**:
1. **Protocol translation**: 6LoWPAN ↔ IPv6
2. **NAT64**: IPv6-only Thread devices reach IPv4 internet
3. **Routing**: Forward packets between Thread and external networks
4. **Commissioning**: Securely add new devices to Thread network

---

### 5.2 NAT64 Translation

**Problem**: Thread devices only speak IPv6, but many services are IPv4.

**NAT64 Prefix**: `64:ff9b::/96`
```
Thread device wants to reach 8.8.8.8:
1. Constructs IPv6: 64:ff9b::808:808 (8.8.8.8 embedded)
2. Sends to Border Router
3. Border Router extracts IPv4: 8.8.8.8
4. Forwards via IPv4 to destination
5. Response reverse-translated
```

**Latency overhead**: 10-20 ms

---

## Lab 6: Security and Cryptography

### 6.1 Why RSA-2048?

**RSA Security** based on difficulty of factoring N = p × q:

| Key Size | Security Level | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| RSA-1024 | ~80-bit | Breakable by nation-states |
| **RSA-2048** | ~112-bit | NIST recommended through 2030 |
| RSA-4096 | ~140-bit | Future-proof, but slow |

**Math**:
```
RSA-1024: 2^80 operations to break
RSA-2048: 2^112 operations to break

Difference: 2^112 / 2^80 = 2^32 = 4 billion times harder
```

**Trade-off**: RSA-2048 signature verification ~2-3 seconds on ESP32 (acceptable for OTA).

---

### 6.2 Signing vs Encryption

| Property | Signing | Encryption |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Purpose | Prove authenticity | Hide content |
| Threat mitigated | Tampering | Eavesdropping |
| OTA use case | Verify firmware is genuine | (Usually not needed) |

**Why sign firmware?**
- Without signature: Attacker replaces firmware with malicious version
- With signature: Bootloader verifies, rejects tampered firmware
- Encryption alone: Attacker can't read but CAN replace

---

### 6.3 DTLS Overhead

**DTLS Handshake** (simplified):
```
6 flights of packets
~2-6 KB of data exchanged
500-3000 ms to complete
```

**Session Resumption**: After initial handshake, can resume with ~200 ms.

**Energy cost**: Significant! Minimize handshake frequency.
- Cache sessions
- Use pre-shared keys (simpler than certificates)
- Keep connections open when possible

---

### Lab 6 Discussion Questions

1. **Why sign firmware instead of just encrypting it?**
   - Encryption hides content but doesn't prevent replacement
   - Signature proves authenticity

2. **What's the cost of security on battery life?**
   - DTLS handshake: ~500-3000 ms of crypto operations
   - AES encryption: ~1 ms per KB (efficient)
   - Solution: Handshake rarely, encrypt always

---

## Lab 7: Power Management

### 7.1 Sleep Modes

**ESP32-C6 Power Consumption**:

| Mode | Current | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| Active (TX) | 80-100 mA | Transmitting |
| Active (RX) | 25-30 mA | Listening |
| Light sleep | ~700 µA | RAM retained, fast wake |
| Deep sleep | ~5-7 µA | RTC only, slow wake |

**Energy Calculation**:
```
Active:  P = 3.3V × 80mA = 264 mW
Deep sleep: P = 3.3V × 7µA = 0.023 mW

Ratio: 264 / 0.023 = 11,500× less power in deep sleep!
```

---

### 7.2 Duty Cycling

**Strategy**: Sleep most of the time, wake briefly to transmit.

```
10% duty cycle:
- Active 6 seconds per minute
- Sleep 54 seconds per minute

Average power = (0.1 × 264 mW) + (0.9 × 0.023 mW) = 26.4 mW
Savings: 264 / 26.4 = 10× battery life extension
```

**Trade-off**: Higher duty cycle = faster response, shorter battery life.

---

### 7.3 Sleepy End Devices (SED)

**Thread SED behavior**:
```
1. Send "I'm going to sleep" to parent router
2. Sleep for poll interval
3. Wake, poll parent: "Any messages for me?"
4. Parent delivers buffered packets
5. Return to sleep
```

**Poll Interval Trade-offs**:

| Interval | Latency | Battery Impact |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| 100 ms | Low | High (frequent wake) |
| 1 second | Medium | Medium |
| 10 seconds | High | Low |

---

## Lab 8: System Integration

### 8.1 End-to-End Latency Breakdown

```

### 8.2 System Availability

**Target**: 99% uptime (< 1.68 hours downtime per week)

**Failure Modes**:
- Node failure → Mesh self-heals (30-60s)
- Border Router failure → Need redundant BR
- Cloud failure → Local-first design continues operation

**MTBF/MTTR**:
- **MTBF** (Mean Time Between Failures): Target > 168 hours
- **MTTR** (Mean Time To Recover): Target < 60 seconds

## Summary: First Principles Checklist

For each lab, ask:

1. **What?** What technology are we using?
2. **How?** How do we configure it?
3. **Why?** Why was it designed this way? ← **This is first-principles thinking!**

**Document your "why" answers in DDR Section 5: First Principles Reflections.**
