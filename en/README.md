# IoT Systems Design Course

**Start Here** | ESP32-C6 • OpenThread • ISO/IEC 30141:2024

---

## Welcome!

This course teaches you to **design complete IoT systems**, not just write code for microcontrollers. Over 8 hands-on labs, you'll build a real wireless sensor network—from radio signals to cloud dashboards—while learning how professional engineers document and make design decisions.

**What you'll build**: A network of battery-powered sensors that talk wirelessly to each other and report data to a mobile app. Think: smart farm monitoring, but you'll understand every layer from the radio waves to the user interface.

### What Makes This Course Different?

| Traditional Embedded Course | This Course |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| "Make it blink" | "Why does it work this way?" |
| Copy-paste code | Understand the principles behind the code |
| Lab reports | Professional engineering documentation |
| Individual components | Complete system integration |
| Focus on coding | Focus on design decisions + coding |

## 🎯 What You'll Deliver

Instead of traditional lab reports, you produce **professional engineering artifacts**:

### 1. Design Decision Record (DDR)
A living document tracking your architectural decisions, updated each lab.
- Maps work to ISO/IEC 30141 domains (PED, SCD, ASD, OMD, UD, RAID)
- Documents design choices (ADRs)
- Records performance measurements

**Template:** [3_deliverables_template.md](3_deliverables_template.md)

### 2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Standalone justifications for major technical decisions.
- Example: "Why CoAP instead of MQTT?"
- Includes alternatives considered, tradeoffs, consequences

### 3. Performance Reports
Verification that your system meets operational requirements.
- Example: "Mesh healing time < 60s"
- Baselines in [references.md](references.md)

### 4. Stakeholder Summaries
Different audiences care about different aspects:
- **Samuel (Architect)**: Technical depth, ISO alignment
- **Gustavo (Product)**: Cost, performance, business value
- **Edwin (Operations)**: Deployment, troubleshooting
- **Sebastian (Security)**: Threat mitigation, compliance
- **Daniela (Farmer)**: Test system on field

## 🏗️ Architecture Framework (ISO/IEC 30141:2024)

**In simple terms**: Just like a building has a blueprint, IoT systems have an architecture standard. We use **ISO/IEC 30141:2024**—an international framework that helps us organize and talk about IoT systems professionally.

**Why this matters to you**: When you finish this course, you'll be able to discuss your work using the same language that professional IoT engineers use worldwide.

### Six Functional Domains (The Building Blocks)

Think of your IoT system as having six main areas of responsibility. Don't worry about memorizing these now—you'll learn them as you build:

**In plain English**:
1. **Physical stuff** (sensors in soil)
2. **Sensor devices** (reading temperature/moisture)
3. **Applications** (processing the data)
4. **Operations** (keeping everything running)
5. **User interfaces** (dashboards for farmers)
6. **Security & data exchange** (protecting information)

**Technical view** (you'll understand this by Week 2):

```
PED (Physical Entity Domain)
  ↕ Sensing/Actuation
SCD (Sensing & Controlling Domain) ← Labs 1-2, 5
  ↕ Data/Commands
ASD (Application & Service Domain) ← Labs 3-4, 7-8
  ↕ Management
OMD (Operation & Management Domain) ← Labs 6-8
  ↕ User Interaction
UD (User Domain) ← Labs 7-8
  ↔ Auth/API
RAID (Resource Access & Interchange) ← Labs 4, 6
```

### Six Viewpoints

You'll analyze your system from six complementary viewpoints:

| Viewpoint | Question | Labs |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Foundational** | What is an IoT system? | 1-2 |
| **Business** | Why build this? | 8 |
| **Usage** | Who uses it and how? | 7 |
| **Functional** | What does it do? | 1-8 |
| **Trustworthiness** | How is it secure? | 6, 8 |
| **Construction** | How do we build it? | 1-8 |

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read ahead**: Review next week's lab before class
2. **Use references**: Bookmark [references.md](references.md) for quick lookups
3. **Document as you go**: Update your DDR immediately after each lab
4. **Think like an architect**: Always ask "why?" not just "how?"
